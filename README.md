The Clean Architecture
Robert C. Martin aka Uncle Bob father of the clean architecture, which enforces the Solid principles.
It has 3 different layers:

Presentation Layer:
Focuses on presenting the data on UI.
Contains Android components like Activities/Services/Fragments etc. and Custom Views.
Contains Presenters
Presenters can be any of the MVC/MVP/MVVM patterns. MVP is used most favorably for presentation purposes though.
Here based on the Data changes, the View is updated.


So the presentation layer only focuses on how the data is presented on the UI.
Domain Layer:
Focuses on the business logic.
Contains the Data Models
Contains the screen/view interfaces
Use cases (different functionalities which exist in our application).
This layer is pure Java/Kotlin based and is Android free.



Data layer:
Focuses on data(external/internal).
Contains any external API's access.
Local Storage Components.
Memory/disk caches.
